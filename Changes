2.77  - 

2.76  - Jun 04, 2005

 - new feature funded by Lewis Bergman: statsdir can now be an 
     absolute path (ex: /var/www/html). If so, processor output will 
     be stored in statsdir/vhost. Otherwise, it works as it used to
     and output goes to vhost/statsdir. This is useful if you have a
     seperate machine (not the web server) that does the processing
     and that system does not have access to the vhost docroot.

2.75  - Feb 05, 2005

 - you can now select which stats processor is used for each
     virtual host. Create a .processor file in the stats dir and
     place the name of the processor on the first line.
 - test to make sure the log file exists before trying to 
     compress it (supresses spurious warnings)
 - If vhosts are all in a directory, skip any files that end
     with ~ (vim) or .bak (user). 
 - the code that hashed the domain list collected the settings
     from httpd.conf and stuffed them into a hash with the name
     of the vhost. This worked great, as long as ServerName was
     the first declaration in your httpd.conf. I discovered this
     fails otherwise. Now it stuffs the settings into a hash
     and then, after all the data is collected, moves the data
     into a new hash keyed off the vhost servername. The function
     now works regardless of order in the vhost container.
 - If a perl module was missing, the script would fail after 
     attempting to load Mail::Toaster::Perl (which may not exist)
     Added Apache::Logmonster::Perl to distro


2.74  - Nov 26, 2004
 - package is now named Apache::Logmonster to fit nicely
   into a CPAN category
 - bundled up for CPAN & freshmeat release
 - Makefile.PL
   - updated package NAME
   - removed MATT::* dependency, added Compress::Zlib dep
 - logmonster.pl
   - updated package name
 - added more example settings to logmonster.conf
 - cleaned up pod docs for prettier web page formatting
 - added TODO file
 - remove MATT::Bundle reference from FAQ

2.73  - Nov 12, 2004

 - updated lib/Logmonster/Utility to latest
 - fixed get_the_date bug in Utility
 - added many more tests for Utility
 - fixed a bug in my fileparse call (File::Basename)

2.72  - Nov 11, 2004

 - Removed MATT::Utility dependency
 - added lib/logmonster/Utility (logmonster::Utility)
 - removed Exporter
 - updates for use with logmonster::Utility
 - replaced StripLastDirFromPath with File::Basename

2.71  - Oct 22, 2004

 - Raymond Dijkxhoorn suggested not sorting the files if 
   there's only one host. Shucks, that's a reasonable enough 
   thing to do, for those of you with only one web server. ;-)
 - Logmonster will now dutifully skip sorting logs if only
   one hostname is configured in logmonster.conf

2.70  - 0ct 22, 2004

 - allow for ServerName to have a :80 style suffix
 - added verbose (-v) flag.
 - fixed up reporting so quiet mode is really quiet
    unless there are errors
 - normal output is prettier
 - debugging output is much prettier
 - apache config file parsing is now much more versatile
 - if you have a folder full of files for vhosts, you can
   have multiple vhosts within a file now
 - misc internal changes for efficiency
 - prototyped all subroutines
 - added additional comments here and there
 - added test for FileHandle

2.6.6 - Jun 16, 2004

 - Added inline documentation to a few of the subs
 - Modified SortVhostLogs so that it uses much less memory
   by writing to the log file as we sort instead of building
   an array and then writing the array contents to the file
 - in GetDomainList, I forgot to add domains without aliases
   to %domains 
 - GetServerName: made the regexp search more reliable (no
   known problems but the potential existed).

2.6.5 - Jun 10, 2004

 - Switched date parsing regexp from / / to /\s+/ in 
   SortVhostLogs per Earl Ruby (eruby@switchmanagement.com)
   for compatibility with Apache::Registry

2.6.4 - Apr 14, 2004

  Added regexp notes
  Added additional debugging
  Check for files locally before trying to compress them

2.6.3 - Mar 28, 2004

  Updated regexp to support numeric vhosts
  Updated logmonster.pl pod documentation
  Updated Makefile.PL, added README, FAQ files
  Added BSD copyright

2.6.2 - Mar 11, 2004

  Corrected a typo in the logmonster.pl config file.

2.6.1 - Feb 24, 2004

  Fixed problem where paths with caps weren't detected 
   (search string was lower cased)

2.6   - Feb 21, 2004

  Updated documentation and web site. More informative.

2.5.2 - Sep 24, 2003

  Added a strip leading spaces function to GetVhostsFromFile
  Adjusted so FindTheBin will find awstats in it's default
    location (/usr/local/www/cgi-bin/awstats.pl)

2.5   - Sep 15, 2003

  Fixed a problem with HitsPerVHost not getting written
  Fixed a mis-feature where running logmonster -r was 
    clobbering the active log processing dir. Oops.
  Fixed a couple problems related to interaction between
    script and MATT::Utility
  Made quite a few failures more graceful. This later proved
    to be only beneficial from a theoretical standpoint
    as it didn't solve the problem I was tracking down.

2.4   - Aug 14, 2003

  Updated FetchLogFiles so that you don't need to ssh to localhost
  Updated URLs from matt.simerson.net to tnpi.biz
  Moved configuration from script to logmonster.conf
  Added Changes to the CVS depot
  Added support for AWStats log processor
  Added lots of documentation to logmonster.conf

2.3   - Jul 10, 03

  Added pod documentation.  
  Cleaned up SysCmd calls and now SysCmd calls use MATT::Utility

2.2   - Mar 24, 03

  Moved many subs out of script into modules

2.1.1 - Mar 18, 03

  Report hit counts (-r designed to be used with SNMP and RRDutil)

2.1   - Mar 17, 03

  Moved code out of FetchLogFiles to GetTheLogDir for reuse
  Writes counters to $logdir/HitsPerVhost.txt
  Writes activity log to $logdir/Logmonster.txt
  Renamed $logdir to $logbase

2.0.3 - Mar 07, 03 

  Moved FAQ and Changelog to web site.
  Created web page for logmonster.
  Added support for http-analyze. It should work but I
    haven't used http-analzye in about 5 years so I 
    might be forgetting something.

2.0.2 - Mar 06, 03 

  Added the httpd.conf parsing stuff. Now works with a vhost
    directory or parses out of your httpd.conf - cool :)

2.0.1 - Mar 06, 03 

  Moved vhost log pre-processer checks out of FeedTheMachine
    into CheckStatsDir. Run it before SortVhostLogs so we 
    skip sorting any logs that we aren't going to store.
  Count up invalid lines in log files and report them instead
    of dying when we encounter them.
  Print out prettier logs.

2.0   - Mar 04, 03 

  An entire re-write
  Logic is much cleaner now and way more efficient
  Pulls most settings out of apache config files
  Reporting is much better :)
  Added -b (process archived logs) feature
  Added -h & -m (hourly & monthly processing)
  Added -n (dry run) so you can preview what it'll do
  Now clean enough that I'll make it publicly available

  Major code cleanups
  Reworked fetch_the_files
  Added system_command
  Added FindTheBin

1.3   - Nov 25, 02

  Added getopt::std instead of custom parser
  Moved $quiet to $opt_q, $debug to $opt_v

1.2.1 - Dec 14, 01 

  Made it work with matt.simerson.net

1.2   - Jun 28, 01 

  Cleaned up the code, added debug flag, expanded logic
    so v1.2 can replicate 1.0 & 1.1 behaviour with options

1.1   - Feb 14, 01 

  Added support for multiple domains

1.0   - Oct 29, 00 - Origin
